@unpublished{Muller2013,
abstract = {This paper contains two parts: The first part is devoted to a specific implementation of exact real arithmetic called iRRAM, developed by the author since 1996. It is mainly a user manual for the iRRAM package and contains many references to the second part explaining the theoretical background. The second part is an introduction to the field of computer arithmetic from the viewpoint of exact arithmetic. This implies that hardware specific subjects are treated only rudimentar, while software based are emphasized. Of course, there is no strict border between hardware and software: Software products must be based on what a compiler is able to deliver (which is mainly hardware dependend) and hardware always consists of (more or less elaborate) boolean functions ehanced with flow control. The second part can be used as an introductionary course for graduate students, it expects corresponding knowledge on computability and complexity theory as well as programming experience. Most programming examples are implemented in the iRRAM package, but without explanation of the dietails. Instead, there are many references to the corresponding sections of the first part. The iRRAM package startet as a prototype implementantion for exact arithmetic using the computational model of TTE, which is briefly explained at the end of the second part.},
