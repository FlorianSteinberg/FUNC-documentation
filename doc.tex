\part{Higher type computability theory}

	We assume the reader is familiar with the concepts of computability of real numbers and functions thereon (at least functions on compact intervals).
	For look-up we suggest \cite{MR1005942}, or the freely available \cite{MR2762094} and the references given there.
	Here the former adopts a somewhat analytical point of view, while the later stays closer to the notions of computability theory.
	Another good source is probably \cite{MR1795407}.
	As the main source for things to implement, we feel like the paper \cite{gevrey} should be mentioned in the introduction of this chapter.
	Tough it will be referenced at the multiple places where it is used.

	In the later sections (which might be of lower importance for the implementations) we will discuss complexity theory of functions and operators.
	These topics are not thoroughly discussed in any of the above citations and we point the reader to \cite{}.

\part{\irram}

	In this part, we are going to describe some key features of the \cc library \irram for exact real arithmetic.
	We do not claim our depiction to be complete or self-contained.
	Instead we restrict ourselves to those parts of \irram that are of importance for us, and can neither be found in the official \irram documentation \cite{Muller2009}, nor in the incomplete html-documentation \cite{Muller2001-2003} or \temp{the draft} \cite{Muller2013} \temp{(yet?)}.

\part{Implementation}

	\temp{
		It should be clear, that the right place for our implementations would be the file iRRAM\_functional.h (and maybe a corresponding .cc file).
		As \irram does not yet use \ccOx, which our implementations will rely on heavily, we temporarily locate it as separate file called FUNC.cc in the folder \lq user\_programs\rq\ (or in more current, not yet released versions which miss this folder, in the folder \lq examples\rq).
